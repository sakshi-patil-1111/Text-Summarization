"The grey seal was found at Cruden Bay on Tuesday.
The Scottish SPCA removed the seal from beach and took it to the charity's rescue centre where it was cut free.
Ch Insp John Carle said: ""The amount of netting tangled around the seal's neck was the largest I have ever seen. It was a lovely moment watching the seal heading back into the water.""
He added: ""He was so large and heavy it took three of our officers to lift him and take him to our centre in Drumoak where we cut the net away.
""If he hadn't been discovered and freed the net would eventually have cut through his skin which could have resulted in septicaemia or other infections.
""Thankfully there were no injuries in this case and we were able to release him relatively quickly.
""This was a very happy ending and we're so glad we were able to help.""",A seal found tangled in nets on an Aberdeenshire beach has been returned to the sea.,36043765
